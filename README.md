# polyGraft: A Program for Molecular Structure and Topology Generation of Polymer-Grafted Hybrid Nanostructures

# Prerequisites
- [atomsk](https://atomsk.univ-lille.fr/) for hard substrate generation (any other tools should also be fine, save in pdb file format) (tested v0.12)
- [MDAnalysis](https://www.mdanalysis.org/) file IO (tested v2.5.0)
- [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) accelerated array processing (tested v0.57.1)

Installation steps (tested with Anaconda):
1. install [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/)
2. create a new environment (see [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands)) adding MDAnalysis, numba etc (conda install), using the following
 command under the default env (base):
> conda env create -f environment.yml
3. download atomsk and place under /path/to/polyGraft/bin
4. download polyGraft through github
5. use polyGraft for generation under /path/to/polyGraft/examples

**NOTE**: to use other polymers (rather than PEO) for polymer brush generation using polyGraft, one must provide the gro/itp files of the polymer. The user should be responsible for the results in this case as no validity checks on the input files were applied (i.e., validate the force field parameters and visualize the generated structure etc.)

# How to use
Representative examples are given in the [**examples**](https://github.com/nanogchen/polyGraft/tree/main/examples) folder (check it out!) For any nanostructure generation, it takes two steps generally:
1. generate or import the substrate material (hard or soft), and polymer (gro and itp files);
2. generate the structure and topology using polyGraft. For poly-g-hard, the files are in gro/itp format, while for poly-g-soft, they are in pdb/rtp format.
